%description
rlottie is a platform independent standalone c++ library for rendering vector
based animations and art in realtime.

Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON
format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with
bodymovin, Sketch with Lottie Sketch Export, and from Haiku.

For the first time, designers can create and ship beautiful animations without
an engineer painstakingly recreating it by hand. Since the animation is backed
by JSON they are extremely small in size but can be large in complexity!
